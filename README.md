# Dino game

Dino Run is a basic 2D side-scrolling game where the player controls a dinosaur that needs to survive by running and avoiding obstacles. The goal is to run as far as possible without colliding with any obstacles.

Gameplay:

The game starts with the dinosaur positioned on the ground at the left side of the screen.
As the game begins, obstacles (such as cacti or flying birds) start to appear from the right side of the screen at random intervals.
The player can control the dinosaur using the keyboard. For example, pressing the spacebar will make the dinosaur jump to avoid obstacles.
The dinosaur moves forward automatically, and the player's task is to time their jumps correctly to clear obstacles.
If the dinosaur collides with an obstacle, the game ends and the player's score is displayed.
The score is calculated based on the distance covered by the dinosaur. The longer the dinosaur runs without colliding, the higher the score.
The player can choose to play again after the game ends.
